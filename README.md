```
npm install dew -g
```
`dew` creates a file, tests for that file, and add it to other files dependencies (when specified, not yet impletemented).

This is super alpha, I hope to get it doing more soon.


`dew <filename>` will generate a file and a test file for you, basically it's an optimized touch.

`undew <filename>` will remove the file and any tests associated with it.
